# Multi-Layered Perceptron

In this repository, you'll find a Jupyter Notebook in which I succesfully programmed a MLP from scratch by using PyTorch. This neural network accurately classifies the handwritten digits within the MNIST dataset. This mini-project was part of our practical assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course in University. Below there is an image of the correct predictions the model made:
